The ARM processor has twenty seven registers, some of which have conditions
applied, so you only get to use sixteen at any one time... 
Register 0 to register 7 are general purpose registers and can be used for
ANY purpose.
Unlike 80x86 processors which require certain registers to be used for stack
access, or the 6502 which places the result of mathematical calculations in
the Accumulator, the ARM processor is highly flexible in its register use. 

Register 8 to register 12 are general purpose registers, but they have
shadow registers which come into use when you switch to FIQ mode. 

Register 13 is typically the OS stack pointer, but can be used as a general
purpose register. This is an operating system issue, not a processor issue,
so if you don't use the stack you can corrupt this freely within your own
code as long as you restore it afterwards. Each of the processor modes
shadow this register. 

Register 14 is dedicated to holding the address of the return point to make
writing subroutines easier. When you branch with link (BL) the return
address is stored in R14. 
Likewise when the program is first run, the exit address is stored in R14.
All instances of R14 must be preserved in other registers (not really
efficient) or in a stack. This register is shadowed across all of the
processor modes. This register can be used as a general purpose register
once the link address has been preserved. 

Register 15 is the program counter. It holds the status of the processor as
well as a twenty-six bit number which is the address of the program
currently being used.

R13: stack free pointer (downwards) (per convention)
R14: (current) return address
R15 = PC

The ARM IEEE FP system has eight high precision FP registers (F0 to F7).
