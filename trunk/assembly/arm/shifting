The ARM processor incorporates a barrel shifter that can be used with the
data processing instructions (ADC, ADD, AND, BIC, CMN, CMP, EOR, MOV, MVN,
ORR, RSB, SBC, SUB, TEQ, TST). You can also use the barrel shifter to affect
the index value in LDR/STR operations. 

There are six mnemonics for the different shift types: 
  LSL  Logical Shift Left
  ASL  Arithmetic Shift Left
  LSR  Logical Shift Right
  ASR  Arithmetic Shift Right
  ROR  Rotate Right
  RRX  Rotate Right with Extend
ASL and LSL are the same, and may be freely interchanged. 

You can specify a shift with an immediate value (from zero to thirty one),
or by a register which contains a value between zero and thirty one.
