The allocation of the bits within the CPSR (and the SPSR registers to which
it is saved) is: 
  31 30 29 28  ---   7   6   -   4   3   2   1   0
  N  Z  C  V         I   F       M4  M3  M2  M1  M0

The flags mean: 
  N  Negative        Set if result is negative
  Z  Zero            Set if result is zero
  C  Carry           Set if carry occurs
  O  Overflow        Set if overflow occurs
  I  IRQ             Interrupt disable
  F  FIQ             Fast Interrupt disable
