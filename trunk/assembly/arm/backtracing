An extension to the protocol, used in backtracing, is to embed the function
name into the code.
Immediately before the function (and the MOV ip, sp), you should have the
following: 
        DCD     &FF0000xx
Where 'xx' is the length of the function name string (including padding and
terminator). This string is word-aligned, tail-padded, and should be placed
directly before the DCD &FF.... 

So, your complete stack backtrace code (<256 bytes of stack required) would
look like: 
        DCB     "my_function_name", 0, 0, 0, 0
        DCD     &FF000010
my_function_name
        MOV     ip, sp
        STMFD   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
        SUB     fp, ip, #4

        CMPS    sp, sl                    ; this may be omitted if you
        BLLT    |__rt_stkovf_split_small| ; won't be using stack...
	SUB	sp, sp, #<size of local variables>

        ...process...

        LDMEA   fp, {fp, sp, pc}          ; <-- append '^' for APCS-R
