VS : Overflow Set

will not fit into a 32bit destination register. 

VC : Overflow Clear 
If the V flag is clear, the reverse of VS. 

HI : Higher Than (unsigned) 
If after a comparison the C flag is set AND the Z flag is clear. 

LS : Lower Than or Same (unsigned) 
If after a comparison the C flag is clear OR the Z flag is set. 

PL : Plus 
If the N flag is clear after an arithmetical operation. For the purposes of
defining 'plus', zero is positive because it isn't negative... 

MI : Minus 
If the N flag is set after an arithmetical operation. 

CS : Carry Set 
Set if the C flag is set after an arithmetical operation OR a shift
operation, the result of which cannot be represented in 32bits. You can
think of the C flag as the 33rd bit of the result. 

CC : Carry Clear 
The reverse of CS. 

GE : Greater Than or Equal (signed) 
If after a comparison...
the N flag is set AND the V flag is set
or...
the N flag is clear AND the V flag is clear. 

GT : Greater Than (signed) 
If after a comparison...
the N flag is set AND the V flag is set
or...
the N flag is clear AND the V flag is clear
and...
the Z flag is clear. 

LE : Less Than or Equal To (signed) 
If after a comparison...
the N flag is set AND the V flag is clear
or...
the N flag is clear AND the V flag is set
and...
the Z flag is set. 

LT : Less Than (signed) 
If after a comparison...
the N flag is set AND the V flag is clear
or...
the N flag is clear AND the V flag is set.
