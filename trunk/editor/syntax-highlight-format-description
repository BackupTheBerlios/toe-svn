configurable:
- lexer rules
- of them, keywords
- of them, comments
- of them, literal strings/numbers
- of them, intellisense triggers (e.g. ".", "::")
- (of them, virtual indent triggers)
- auto-tabbing rules (front-tab, ...)
- smart-home, smart-back, purify
- mime-type list(, description) <-> xdgmime
- beware of stuff like #if 0 ... #endif that can't be represented as a clean lexer rule
