The U.S.'s latest adventure reflects previous breaches of international law
for the sake of the "good"

The invading nation claimed that it had no choice because it was threatened,
and it was only trying to remove a repressive, cruel, and dictatorial
warlord so that it could eventually restore self-government and work toward
a freer and more prosperous country that could only benefit from the
superior way of life the invaders were bringing.

One brave country, however, stood up and issued a diplomatic note that
categorically denied "that there is need or warrant for any one Power to
take upon itself to prescribe what shall be the terms and conditions of a
'new order' in areas not under its sovereignty and to constitute itself the
repository of authority and the agent of destiny in regard thereto." That
brave country was even more emphatic when the invaders announced it would be
necessary to bomb major cities from the air in order to accomplish their
objectives.

"The Government is of the opinion that any bombardment of an extensive zone
containing a sizeable population engaged in their peaceful pursuits is
inadmissible and runs counter to the principles of law and humanity."
